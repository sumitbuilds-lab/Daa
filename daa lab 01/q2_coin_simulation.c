/*
 * Q2: Fair vs Biased Coin
 * -----------------------
 * Goal : Simulate coin tosses in C to empirically show that a fair
 *        coin gives P(HEAD) ~ 0.5, then extend to a biased coin and
 *        compare.
 *
 * Algorithm (Monte Carlo simulation):
 *   1. For a fair coin, generate N random tosses; each toss is HEAD
 *      if a uniform random number in [0,1) < 0.5, else TAIL.
 *   2. For a biased coin, use a chosen bias p (e.g. 0.7) as the
 *      threshold instead of 0.5.
 *   3. Count heads, compute observed probability = heads / N.
 *   4. As N grows, observed probability converges to the true
 *      probability (Law of Large Numbers).
 *
 * Time Complexity : O(N) - one constant-time random draw per toss.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only counters are stored.
